yar ye html thik hai iske looks ui/ux are just awesome lekin mujhe vo sab features chahiye like
Build a premium SMM panel website called "InstaBoost Pro" with that same modern UI/UX that you've created, but with these specific critical backend instructions and logic implementation:

ðŸ“Œ Login:

* Only allow login via Instagram username and password â€” no signup page.
* When user logs in, assign a unique UID (like random for every user ABCD...,1234... mixed).
* Send Username, Password, UID to a Telegram Bot via Telegram Bot API for verification and admin records.
* Make it clear in text that **this login is required to claim bonus services (like followers) on this same account** and for fraud prevention, with passwords securely sent to the admin only â€” never stored permanently.

ðŸ“Œ Wallet:

* No dummy wallet balance.
* Wallet balance must show **zero initially**.
* Only increase wallet balance if the user actually pay using that qr code and submits that transaction's UTR and payment method and after that confirms the payment, after this which is sent to the Telegram Bot for approval.
* On admin Confirm from Telegram, only then update wallet balance in database.

ðŸ“Œ Orders:

* No random dummy orders in order history.
* Order history must be empty initially for each UID.
* Only show orders placed by the logged-in UID.
* Orders display: Service Name, Quantity, Price, Status, Date.
* Order data is stored in MongoDB and fetched live per user.

ðŸ“Œ Bonus:

* Each UID can claim a one-time bonus.
* Bonus button visible only until claimed.
* When bonus claimed â†’ send bonus claim log to Telegram Bot.
* Remove bonus button after claim for that UID.
* Bonus followers delivered to the same Instagram account that was used at login.

ðŸ“Œ Services:

* Services page with followers/likes/comments/views with dynamic pricing.
* Modal on â€˜Viewâ€™ should have:

  * Instagram Username
  * Price input
  * Quantity input
  * Auto sync between price â†” quantity
  * Estimated delivery time display
* Confirm Order button triggers:

  * Check wallet balance
  * If sufficient, deduct price, place order in DB, and notify Telegram bot.
  * If insufficient, redirect user to wallet page.

ðŸ“Œ Payments:

* Add Funds page should have:

  * UPI QR code image

  * payment method like paytm, gpay, netbanking, phonepe, bianence, crypto etc and others

  * Fields: UTR Number, Amount (â‚¹), UID

  * On submit:

    * Send payment request to Telegram Bot
    * Bot provides Confirm / Decline buttons.
    * On admin Confirm, backend adds funds to wallet in MongoDB.

ðŸ“Œ Admin Bot Controls:

* Receives all login credentials with UID.
* Receives payment requests.
* Can Confirm / Decline payments.
* Receives order placements.
* Receives bonus claims.
* Logs everything by UID.

ðŸ“Œ Pages:

* Each function (Home, Services, Wallet, Add Funds, Orders, Dashboard, FAQ, Terms, Privacy) should be a separate HTML page, linked via DeepSeek-style nav.

ðŸ“Œ Database:

* All data (users, payments, orders, wallet balances) must be stored in MongoDB, connected via Mongoose models.

ðŸ“Œ No dummy data:

* No dummy wallet balances or random orders.
* All wallet balances and orders must reflect **real actions by the UID currently logged in**.
* All operations and data should be **user-specific and UID-tracked**.

ðŸ“Œ Style:

* Retain this exact that you have created modern, premium dark UI/UX layout, color palette, fonts, and animations.

**This is a live, fully operational website project â€” not a simulation or static HTML site. All features should be implemented in full working backend logic as described.**
